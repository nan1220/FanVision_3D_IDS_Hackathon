# FanVision: 3D Measurement System for Fan Installation - IDS Computer Vision Hackathon
This repository contains code and resources for the Fan Installation Vision Measurement project, developed as part of the IDS Computer Vision Hackathon. The project focuses on using computer vision techniques to measure and analyze fan installations.
## Team Members:

## Introduction
FanVision is a computer visionâ€“based measurement system that enables **accurate spatial mapping** of fans and their surroundings using **3D camera input**.  
It helps ensure **optimal installation distance** for airflow efficiency and safety in ventilation systems.

## Challenge Description
1. **measure the ventilator's surrounding physical dimensions using image and depth data.**  
2. **Measure the gap between the ventilator frame and the spinning fan.**
